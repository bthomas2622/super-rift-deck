# Riftbound Deckbuilder

A web-based deckbuilder for **Riftbound**, the Trading Card Game by Riot Games. Built as a static site for GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Card Browser** — Browse all Riftbound cards with images from the Riftcodex CDN

- **Deck Building** — Build decks with Legend, Chosen Champion, Main Deck (40+), Rune Deck (12), Battlefields (3), and Sideboard slots
- **Deck Details** — Analytics views including energy cost distribution, power cost distribution, power differential by domain, might distribution, tag breakdown, and keyword counts — charts are color-coded by card type
- **Rules Validation** — Real-time enforcement of Riftbound deck construction rules:
  - Domain Identity constraints based on Champion Legend
  - Chosen Champion must share a tag with your Legend
  - Max 3 copies of any named card
  - Max 3 total Signature cards matching your Legend's champion tag
  - Rune Deck exactly 12, Battlefields exactly 3 with unique names
- **Import / Export** — Copy deck lists to clipboard or import from text
- **Sample Deck** — One-click load of a sample Budget Jinx decklist
- **Hand Simulator** — Draw a simulated opening hand of 4 cards and mulligan up to 2
- **Card Preview** — Hover over cards in the deck list to preview them in the main panel, or right-click any card for a full-screen view
- **Collapsible Deck Panel** — Toggle the deck sidebar open/closed to maximize card browsing space

## GitHub Actions

### Nightly Card Fetch

Runs daily at 3 AM UTC (and on manual trigger). Fetches the latest card data from the Riftcodex API and commits any changes to `public/data/`.

### Update Banned Cards

Extracts the current banned card list and updates `src/components/filters.js` accordingly.

### GitHub Pages Deploy

Triggers on push to `main`. Builds the Vite project and deploys to GitHub Pages.

## Card Data

Card data is sourced from the [Riftcodex API](https://riftcodex.com/docs/endpoints/cards/), an unofficial free Riftbound API. Images are hotlinked from the Riftcodex CDN — no images are stored locally.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite** — Build tool and dev server
- **Vanilla JS** — No framework, lightweight and fast
- **GitHub Pages** — Static hosting
